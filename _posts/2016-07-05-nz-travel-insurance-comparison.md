When you're going travelling, most people would tell you to buy travel insurance. When you're going on a round-the-world graduation trip to countries including Cambodia and Egypt, it's a no-brainer — buy the most comprehensive policy you can find. But with so many companies offering travel insurance, it's hard to know exactly which one is the right one for you. Ideally, the travel insurance you purchase would cover all that you'll need and nothing more, so that you're not paying extra for unnecessary benefits.

Not having any prior experience with travel insurance and being the type of person who gets unsettled by the idea of making uninformed decisions, I naturally had to do some research before agreeing to purchase the policy recommended by the travel agent. But my research quickly led me to a video (below), recommended by my Youtube sidebar, that showed how dangerous buying travel insurance without fully understanding the policy can be. Purchasing a travel insurance, in essence, is signing a legal document that binds the insurer to do certain things for you after you pay the agreed amount of money. It's a lot like buying a house, or getting a divorce, except it involves your health, and that big chunk of money you saved up for your trip, and most importantly, your life. Yet, unlike buying a house or getting a divorce, most people don't hire a lawyer when they buy travel insurance, and a lot of people don't even bother to read the policy wording, so they have no idea what they're paying the money for. No wonder we see so many complaints on travel insurance review sites about not getting reimbursements for incidents the buyer thought were covered but actually weren't.

So I decided to dig deeper, and eventually read through just about every travel insurance policy wording document available to New Zealanders. It was overkill, I know, but at least now every one of you reading this can save some time and not buy the wrong travel insurance, which hopefully adds up to a lot more saved time and money.*

_* Of course, this doesn't mean you won't have to read anything before purchasing your travel insurance. You'll still need to read the policy wording of the insurance you're buying, but at least you won't have to read the legal documents of every travel insurance policy in New Zealnd like I did._

# The Findings

I went through the comprehensive travel insurance policies provided by 25 different companies. All are available to New Zealanders, all provide a quote automatically when you input your travel details on their website.

Here are a few themes I found:

* Most travel insurance policies seem to have very similar sections, such as cancellation fee, accidental death, delay, etc. However, simply comparing the benefit limits would not necessarily give you an accurate idea of which policy is better, as each policy has different exclusions under each section, which means even if policy A offers a higher limit in a particular section than policy B, policy B might still be better for that section if policy A excludes everything that you need covered in that section.
* Some policies don't cover certain countries or regions even though the insurance offered is supposed to have "worldwide" coverage. They don't list the countries that aren't covered either. They just state in the policy wording that the policy excludes countries rated "extreme risk" or "high risk" or not recommended by the [safetravel](https://safetravel.govt.nz) website, which probably excludes more countries than you would think, and it's up to you to check if where you're heading to is covered.
* Some policies don't cover activities that most people consider normal to do on a holiday, like scuba diving or skiing. Even when the activities are covered, some policies have specific exceptions, such as you're only covered for scuba diving if you already hold a PADI certificate, which means if you're going to take a PADI course to get the certificate, or if you're diving under the supervision of a licensed instructor, you're not covered. For skiing and other snow sports, a lot of insurers will ask you to pay extra for added snow sports coverage.
* Some policies don't give the option to lower the excess to $0 by paying more premium, which means for every incident that you try to make a claim for, you'll first need to pay at least $100 (sometimes more). This basically renders claiming for stolen money or valuables worth less than $200 — given the slow and troublesome claiming process — unworthy and pointless for most.
* Some policies force you to use a public hospital. Yep, even if you're in a developing country with public hospitals that do not meet the western medical standards.
* Some policies don't allow you to pay an extra premium to cover pre-existing medical conditions. Before you skip to the next bullet point thinking that you don't have any pre-existing medical conditions, be aware that "pre-existing medical conditions" is defined differently by almost every insurer, and a lot of them define it as anything that you've seen a doctor for. Some even count medical conditions that you've had checks for, even when the results turned out to be negative.
* Adding pre-existing medical conditions that aren't specifically excluded actually isn't as difficult and invasive as one would imagine with some insurers. The additional premium is determined automatically online, and I have seen policies that ask for the same additional premium no matter how many conditions you add.
* A lot of companies offering seemingly different policies actually use the same underwriters, so even though the limits might differ, the details of the policies (like general exclusions) are very similar. More interestingly, some companies offer a better quote than the underwriters themselves, and the policies are very similar.
* A lot of insurers that offer other types of insurance will give you a discount if you purchase travel insurance from them. So keep an eye out for companies that you already use.

Instead of listing all the benefit limits of each policy (which is not that useful anyway — see first bullet point above), I thought it would be better to simply list the pitfalls of each policy. I will order the list below from the cheapest to most expensive*, so you can go through each policy, and if the pitfalls don't matter to you, you'll have found the best policy for you.

_* The quotes are based on my trip, which lasts 51 days and includes countries in Southeast Asia, Japan, Africa, and the Middle East. It also includes activities such as scuba diving and skiing. This itinerary almost always gets the worldwide (or equivalent) coverage with snow sports added on, which is usually highest coverage and most expensive available. While you will surely get a different quote based on your own itinerary, the ordering below should still give a pretty accurate picture of how expensive the insurance policies are relative to each other, as the quotes used for ordering are all based on the same itinerary._

_! Note: I am not including the companies that don't allow you to lower the excess to $0, as this guide is about comprehensive insurance policies, and I really don't think getting comprehensive with an excess more than $0 is a good idea. I will, however, list these policy companies here, if you want to consider them anyway:_

* _ACE/Aon_
* _American Express_
* _Columbus_
* _Expedia_
* _Southern Cross_
* _Tower_
* _World Nomads (sadly this is the most recommended travel insurance by guidebooks and travel bloggers)_

Ok, here we go.

* Doesn't allow extension of pre-existing medical conditions. This is defined as:
    * An ongoing medical or dental condition of which you are aware, or related complication you have or the symptoms of which you are aware; OR
    * A medical or dental condition that is currently being, or has been, investigated or treated by a health professional (including dentist or chiropractor) at any time in the past, prior to policy purchase; OR
    * Any condition for which you take prescribed medicine; OR
    * Any condition for which you have had surgery; OR
    * Any condition for which you see a medical specialist; OR
    * Pregnancy.
* Doesn't seem to cover domestic treatment for when you return to NZ due to injury or illness, so once you return you have to pay your own medical bills.

* You have to pay for Trip Cancellation & Luggage Protection separately, and there is a limit of $3000 maximum. The current quote is with the $3000 maximum added on. I do not think $3000 is enough for both trip cancellation and luggage.
* No extension for pre-existing medical conditions.

Quote: $385.10 | Underwriter: Cigna

* This has to be the travel insurance policy with the most pitfalls. Their Quick Cover Guide makes their policy seem fantastic, with high limits and low premiums. But the policy has so many strange exclusions and the wording is extremely vague. I wrote an email to them asking to clarify some of their policy statements and received no reply (even though they replied to a previous email I sent about country coverage within three hours). After a few days without reply, I called about the email, and they confirmed that they have indeed received my email, and offered to answer my questions over the phone instead. What followed was an excruciating 45-minute-long phone call (I gave up halfway through my list of questions when I realised there was no hope of getting anything useful out of them) during which I had to read out their policy to them (even though I quoted the statements in my original email, which they had in front of them), tell them where the statements were located in their own policy guide, and then repeat my questions several times to the customer service rep who kept ignoring my questions and reading out irrelevant sections of the policy to me, then repeatedly asking me "do you understand what I mean?" I was then repeated told, for almost every question about coverage, that they could not give a definite answer because what I was asking had not occurred yet and that they could only "have a stance on it once an incident had occurred". For example, apparently they could not answer if they would cover my checked luggage if it were stolen, because it hasn't been stolen yet.
* If the above point hasn't convinced you to skip to the next insurer, have a read of their definition for accidental death:

> Accidental Death means death that results solely and directly from an accident on **public transport** and there are no other contributing causes such as an existing medical condition. An accident is a single, sudden, unintended, external event causing bodily injury. The bodily injury must occur independently of any illness, disease, naturally occurring condition or degenerative process.

* There are many, many more pitfalls. If you want the whole list, message me or leave a comment below and I will send you the email that I sent them with the questions that they would not answer.

## [Downunder (DU) Insure](http://www.duinsure.co.nz/)
Quote: $392.32 | Underwriter: Allianz

* Doesn't cover any location rated "Extreme Risk" or "High Risk" or constitutes a general advice against all travel or all non-essential travel to or in that location in a NZ government travel advisory (i.e., safetravel)
* Doesn't cover loss of income, if you were to get injured during your trip and cannot return to work
* You'll need to complete a pre-existing medical condition declaration pdf form, which is manually processed and takes one business day

This is actually a pretty good inexpensive policy if you are not travelling to a high-risk country. Unfortunately, I am.

## [South Sure](http://www.southsure.co.nz/pages/comprehensivetravel/)
Quote: $405 | Underwriter: Allianz

* No scuba diving unless you have a PADI or NAUI
* Even though the policy specifically covers terrorism, which most other policies specifically do not, there is a general exclusion: "the New Zealand Government’s recommendation that travel not be taken to any country, territory or region, if the warning has been issued prior to the purchase of this insurance, whether this relates to essential or non-essential travel or both;" However, the NZ government advises against travel to most countries with terrorism. So unless you bought the travel insurance before a terrorism warning, you're not covered for terrorism, or anything else really.
* Doesn't cover loss of income, if you were to get injured during your trip and cannot return to work

I didn't find any significant pitfalls. There are a few minor ones such as having to provide receipts for everything, even clothing and toiletry, but their reply to my email suggests that they will act reasonably. If you want the details, message me or leave a comment below and I will forward you the email with their answers.

## [AMI](https://www.ami.co.nz/travel-insurance)
Quote: $582.00 (for $8000 cancellation cover) | Underwriter: Great Lakes Reinsurance | Powered by Covermore

* We're getting to the very expensive (read: overpriced) insurance policy quotes. The price is probably the biggest argument against purchasing the policies from here onwards, especially as the policies themselves are most likely very similar to the ones above with the same underwriter. If you are sure you cannot get any of the policies above, then go through the policy wording for these carefully yourself, and watch out for the pitfalls mentioned above for insurers with the same underwriter.

## [State](https://www.state.co.nz/travel-insurance)

* Exactly the same as AMI. You get a discount if you're an existing customer of either.

# I have ignored
* Pricing difference if you're a senior
* Vehicle rental coverage

# Other Helpful Resources
* [Canstar Travel Insurance Star Ratings](http://cdn.canstar.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Travel-Insurance-NZ-2016-10-03-2016.pdf) has tables with benefit limits of different policies. I find the way they ordered the best to worst policies according to different types of travellers confusing, as they don't explain exactly how or why they ordered it that way, and neither do they tell us what itinerary they're basing the ratings on. But the limits could be useful if you're just wanting to compare the limits after having read the policy wording documents.
* Travel blog posts that cover what to look out for. They usually recommend insurance policies in the US, and invariably always recommend World Nomads with an affiliate link, but the general advice is great, such as what to look out for when reading through the policy wording. One good example is [NomadicMatt](http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-insurance/). You can find others by doing a simple Google search.

Hopefully this was helpful. If you see anything that is out of date or incorrect, or if I have missed any pitfalls or anything else, please let me know and I will update accordingly — thanks!
