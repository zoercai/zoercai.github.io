This book is definitely worth coming back to and reading completely. The first seven chapters cover the theory and I presume explain things more fully. Below is a summary of pages 200 to 217 from Chapter 8, which covers the practical parts and also includes examples and stories.

How We Learn by Benedict Carey also looked good and easy to read, it covers some of the same content, but I feel like it has some non-overlapping bits too. Worth reading as well.

# Retrieval Practice

- Without looking at the text, ask yourself:
    - What are the key ideas?
    - What terms or ideas are new to me?
    - How would I define them?
    - How do the ideas relate to what I already know?
- Do questions at the end of study guides
- Generate questions yourself and write down the answers
- Set aside time every week throughout the semester to quiz yourself on the course material, both current week and previous weeks
- Always check answers to make sure your judgements are correct

# Space out your retrieval practice

- Study information more than once but leave considerable time between practice sessions
    - Names & faces: practice again within a few minutes
    - New material in text: practice again within a day or so, then not again for several days or a week
    - When sure of mastery, quiz once a month
- Over the semester, as you quiz yourself on new material, also reach back to retrieve prior material and ask yourself how that knowledge relates to what you have subsequently learned.
- Shuffle flashcards after you correctly answer a couple of times until they’re well mastered. Then revisit monthly.
- Interleave study of two or more subjects so that you continually refresh your mind on each topic as you return to it

# Interleave the study of different problem types

- Once you reach the point where you understand a new problem type and its solution but your grasp of it is still rudimentary, scatter this problem type throughout your practice sequence so that you are alternately quizzing yourself on various problem types and retrieving the appropriate solutions for each.
- Mix in the practice of other subjects, other skills, constantly challenging yours ability to recognise the problem type and select the right solution.

# Other Effective study strategies

- **Elaboration**: relate the material to what you already know, explain it to somebody else in your own words or relate it to your life outside of class. Discover a metaphor or visual image
- **Generation**: attempt to answer a question or solve a problem before being shown the answer. Try to explain beforehand the key ideas you expect to find in class material and how you expect they will relate to your prior knowledge. Try to solve the problems before you get to class in maths or science.
- **Reflection**: What went well? What could have gone better? What other knowledge or experiences does it remind you of? What might you need to learn for better mastery, or what strategies might you use the next time to get better results?
- **Calibration**: actually answer the questions in the quiz instead of just looking at the question and moving on without writing down the answer, giving the illusion of knowing
- **Mnemonic Devices**: mnemonics, memory palaces...

# Tips

- Decide what’s important
- Always do reading prior to a lecture
- Anticipate test questions and their answers as you read
- Answer rhetorical questions in your head during lectures to test retention of the reading
- Review study guides, find unfamiliar terms
- Copy bolded terms and their definitions into a reading notebook
- Take practice tests to discover concepts you don’t know
- Reorganise course information into a study guide of your own design
- Write out concepts that are detailed or important, post them above your bed, test yourself on them from time to time
- Space out your review and practice over the duration of the course
