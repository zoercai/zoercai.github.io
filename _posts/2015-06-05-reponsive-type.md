#Responsive Typography
I'm trying to figure out an approach to responsive typography sizing on this site, and somehow thought it would be nice to read about all the basics of responsive design before picking between rem and em – bad idea. So today I've been reading about fluid grids, font sizes, and a great many things that I had already known but wasn't sure if I had known, such as this [A List Apart article](alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design). So now I know I know, if that makes any sense. (For what it's worth, A List Apart *is* a great resource for web developers.)
I am considering using [FlowType](http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/) and [SlabText](http://freqdec.github.io/slabText) for this site.

#Github Issues
Found [waffle.io](https://waffle.io) which is a great way of managing issues in Github - because creating them in Github itself requires too much clicking. I tried [Gitdone](http://gitdone.co) and [ghi](https://rubygems.org/gems/ghi/versions/0.9.3) before settling with waffle.io.

#Making Chrome more like Safari & How to Read RSS?
Chrome is great for, well, everything. But Safari seems to be better at reading-related needs, with its reading list, rss subscription, and reading mode. So now I'm using [Clearly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iooicodkiihhpojmmeghjclgihfjdjhj) for reading mode, and [PickPocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ohfomjjafcdfkdodojjgkhlepcofaail) for reading list. As for rss subscription, I'm still looking for a solution. I used to use [Feedly](feedly.com) a lot, but Google Reader was probably on to something when it quit the rss market. Having a whole lot of new blog posts to read everyday becomes a task when they're all at one place and you see how many unread posts you "have" to get through. In that respect, social networks like Facebook and Tumblr do a great job at not making keeping up with whatever you're following feel like clearing up your inbox – you're not pressured to read every update, but you won't miss the important ones even if you don't check very often. So if I don't end up finding a solution, a rss reader that organises content like Facebook is going into my project ideas box.
