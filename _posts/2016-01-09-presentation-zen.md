## Preparation

### Use pen and paper, or a whiteboard

>Many of us spend too much time fidgeting with and worrying about bullets and images on slides during the preparation stage instead of thinking about how to craft a story which is the most effective, memorable, and appropriate for our particular audience.

### Wrong questions to ask

* How many bullets per slide?
* How many slides?

###  Right questions to ask

* How much time do I have?
* What's the venue like?
* What time of the day?
* Who is the audience?
* What's their background?
* What do they expect of me?
* Why was I asked to speak?
* What do I want them to do?
* What visual medium is most appropriate for this particular situation and audience?
* What is the fundamental purpose of my talk?
* What's the story here?
* **What is my absolutely central point?** (i.e., If the audience could remember only one thing, what do you want it to be?)
* **Why does it matter? So what?**
* Can you pass the "elevator test"? 

> Imagine this is the situation: You have been scheduled to pitch a new idea to the head of product marketing at your company, one of the leading technology manufactures in the world. Both schedules and budgets are tight; this is an extremely important opportunity for you if you are to succeed at getting the OK from the executive team. When you arrive at the admin desk outside the vice-president's office, suddenly she comes out with her coat and briefcase in hand and says, "... sorry, something's come up, give me your idea as we walk down to my car..." Could you sell your idea in the elevator ride and the walk to the parking lot?

### Handouts can set you free
> If you create a proper handout as a leave-behind fro your presentation during the preparation phase, then you will not feel compelled to say everything about your topic in your talk.

Keep the slides simple, and never hand out copies of your slides.


## Crafting the Story

### What makes messages stick?

* **Simplicity.** Simplify the message to its absolute core. What's the key point? What's the core? Why does (or should) it matter?
* **Unexpectedness.** Get people's interest by violating their expectations. Pose questions or open holes in people's knowledge and then fill those holes. Take people on a journey.
* **Concreteness.** Use natural speech and give real examples with real things, not abstractions. Proverbs are good. "Kill two birds with one stone" is better than "let's work toward maximising our productivity by increasing efficiency across many departments..."
* **Credibility.** We reach for numbers and cold hard data to support our claims, but statistics aren't inherently helpful. Context and meaning are more important. Put it in terms that people can visualise. "Enough battery life to watch your favourite TV shows nonstop on your iPod during your next flight from San Fran to New York" is better than "Five hours of battery life". There are many ways to establish credibility – a quote from a client or the press may help, but a long-winded account of your company's history will bore your audience.
* **Emotions.** Images of the aftermath of Katrina hurricane and floods and human suffering that occurred tell the story in ways that words, text, and data alone never could. Put your ideas in human terms. Use a picture of an enormous plate of greasy French fries, two cheeseburgers, and a large chocolate shake instead of saying "one hundred grams of fat".
* **Stories.** Use stories, examples, and illustrations.

#### Storytelling

##### It's not just about information

> We are living in a time where fundamental human talents are in great demand. Anyone – indeed any machine – can read a list of features or give a stream of facts to an audience. That's not what we need or want. What we year for is to listen to an intelligent and evocative – perhaps at times even provocative – human being who teaches us, or inspires us, or who stimulates us with knowledge plus meaning, context, and emotion in a way that is memorable.
> And this is where story comes in. Information plus emotion and visualisation wrapped in unforgettable anecdotes are the stuff that stories are made of.
> Presentations are not just about following a formula for transferring facts in your head to the heads of those sitting before you by reciting a list of points on a slide. (If it were, why not send an email and cancel the presentation?) what people want is something fundamentally more human. They want to hear "the story" of your facts.

##### Finding your voice

> When you are in a conversation with someone you are naturally more engaged because you have an obligation to participate. Formal speech and formal writing devoid of any emotion whatsoever is extremely difficult to stay with for more than a few minutes. Your conscious mind has to remind you to "stay awake, this is important!" But someone who speaks in a natural, human, conversational style is far easier to stay engaged with.

### The Process

1. Brainstorm. Get analog, do not edit ideas, let it flow.
2. Group and identify the core. Identify the key idea that is central and memorable from the point of view of the audience. Group similar ideas while looking for unifying theme. One core message + three supporting parts/“acts” is a good structure.
3. Storyboard using post-it notes or print out blank slides.
4. Storyboard in Slide Sorter/Light Table view. Duplicate section slides, which should be a different colour with enough contrast that they stand out when you see them in the slide sorter view. Have an introduction to introduce the issue or “the pain” and introduce the core message.

### Editing and Restraint

> Always keep the audience in mind by first keeping your talk as short as you can and still doing an effective job telling your story. After you have prepared your presentation, go back and edit like crazy, eliminating parts that are not absolutely crucial to your overall point or purpose of the talk. You must be ruthless. When in doubt, cut it out.


## Design

### Kanso, Shizen, Shibumi

* **Kanso (Simplicity).** Beauty and visual elegance are achieved by elimination and omission. “Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means.” 
* **Shizen (Naturalness).** Do not use elaborate designs, do not over-refine, do not overplay. Include only what’s necessary to communicate the particular message for the particular audience.
* **Shibumi (Elegance).** Elegant simplicity and articulate brevity, and understated elegance.

> Japanese conceptualisation relegates elaborate ornamentation and viid colour usage to the bottom of the taste levels… excess requires no real thought or creativity. The highest level of taste moves beyond the usage of brilliant colours and heavy ornamentation to a simple and subdued refinement that is the beauty of shibumi, which represents the ultimate in good taste through conscious reserve. This is the original ‘less is more’ concept. Less colour – subdued and elegant usage of colour, less clutter…”

The Zen aesthetic values:

* Simplicity
* Subtlety
* Elegance
* Suggestive rather than the descriptive or obvious
* Naturalness (i.e., nothing artificial or forced)
* Empty space
* Stillness, tranquility
* Eliminating the nonessential

####The “Fish Story”

> When Vijay opened his store, he put up a sign that said: “We Sell Fresh Fish Here.” His father stopped by and said that the word “We” suggests an emphasis on the seller rather than the customer, and is really not needed. So the sign was changed to “Fresh Fish Sold Here.”
> His brother came by and suggested that the word “here” could be done away with – it was superfluous. Vijay agreed and changed the sing to “Fresh Fish Sold.”
> Next, his sister came along and said the sign should just say “Fresh Fish.” Clearly, it is being sold; what else could you be doing?
> Later, his neighbour stopped by to congratulate him. Then he mentioned that all passers-by could easily tell that the fish was really fresh. Mentioning the word fresh actually made it sound defensive as though there was room for doubt about the freshness. Now the sign just read: “FISH.”
> As Vijay was walking back to his shop after a break he noticed that one could identify the fish from its smell from very far, at a distance from which one could barely read the sign. He knew there was no need for the word “FISH.”

#### Amplification through simplification

Eliminate the detail.

##### Simplicity is not easy 

The approach may take more time for you to prepare, but if you give a completely worthless one-hour death-by-PowerPoint presentation to an audience of 200, that equals 200 hours of wasted time. But if you instead put in the time, say, 25–30 hours or more of planning and designing the message, and the media, then you can give the world 200 hours of worthwhile, memorable experience.

It is possible to be “too simple”. Your job is to find the balance most appropriate to your situation.

### Design Principles

#### Signal vs Noise Ratio

Communicate and design clearly with as little degradation to the message as possible. If the item can be removed without compromising the visual message, then strong consideration should be given to minimising the element or removing it altogether. E.g. lines in grids or tables can often be made quite thin, lightened, or even removed. And footers and logos, etc. can usually be removed with good results.
