The Presentation Zen approach declutters your presentation and makes you focus on what's important — effectively communicating the correct message to the audience. It doesn't have as much as one would expect to say about public speaking and delivery — you'll need to get a public speaking book or join a toastmaster club for that — but it does calm you down and teach you to craft your message and present it succinctly.

# Preparation

## Use pen and paper, or a whiteboard

>Many of us spend too much time fidgeting with and worrying about bullets and images on slides during the preparation stage instead of thinking about how to craft a story which is the most effective, memorable, and appropriate for our particular audience.

## Wrong questions to ask

* How many bullets per slide?
* How many slides?

##  Right questions to ask

* How much time do I have?
* What's the venue like?
* What time of the day?
* Who is the audience?
* What's their background?
* What do they expect of me?
* Why was I asked to speak?
* What do I want them to do?
* What visual medium is most appropriate for this particular situation and audience?
* What is the fundamental purpose of my talk?
* What's the story here?
* **What is my absolutely central point?** (i.e., If the audience could remember only one thing, what do you want it to be?)
* **Why does it matter? So what?**
* Can you pass the "elevator test"? 

> Imagine this is the situation: You have been scheduled to pitch a new idea to the head of product marketing at your company, one of the leading technology manufactures in the world. Both schedules and budgets are tight; this is an extremely important opportunity for you if you are to succeed at getting the OK from the executive team. When you arrive at the admin desk outside the vice-president's office, suddenly she comes out with her coat and briefcase in hand and says, "... sorry, something's come up, give me your idea as we walk down to my car..." Could you sell your idea in the elevator ride and the walk to the parking lot?

## Handouts can set you free
> If you create a proper handout as a leave-behind for your presentation during the preparation phase, then you will not feel compelled to say everything about your topic in your talk.

Keep the slides simple, and never hand out copies of your slides.


# Crafting the Story

## What makes messages stick?

* **Simplicity.** Simplify the message to its absolute core. What's the key point? What's the core? Why does (or should) it matter?
* **Unexpectedness.** Get people's interest by violating their expectations. Pose questions or open holes in people's knowledge and then fill those holes. Take people on a journey.
* **Concreteness.** Use natural speech and give real examples with real things, not abstractions. Proverbs are good. "Kill two birds with one stone" is better than "let's work toward maximising our productivity by increasing efficiency across many departments..."
* **Credibility.** We reach for numbers and cold hard data to support our claims, but statistics aren't inherently helpful. Context and meaning are more important. Put it in terms that people can visualise. "Enough battery life to watch your favourite TV shows nonstop on your iPod during your next flight from San Fran to New York" is better than "Five hours of battery life". There are many ways to establish credibility – a quote from a client or the press may help, but a long-winded account of your company's history will bore your audience.
* **Emotions.** Images of the aftermath of Katrina hurricane and floods and human suffering that occurred tell the story in ways that words, text, and data alone never could. Put your ideas in human terms. Use a picture of an enormous plate of greasy French fries, two cheeseburgers, and a large chocolate shake instead of saying "one hundred grams of fat".
* **Stories.** Use stories, examples, and illustrations.

## Storytelling

### It's not just about information

> We are living in a time where fundamental human talents are in great demand. Anyone – indeed any machine – can read a list of features or give a stream of facts to an audience. That's not what we need or want. What we year for is to listen to an intelligent and evocative – perhaps at times even provocative – human being who teaches us, or inspires us, or who stimulates us with knowledge plus meaning, context, and emotion in a way that is memorable.
> And this is where story comes in. Information plus emotion and visualisation wrapped in unforgettable anecdotes are the stuff that stories are made of.
> Presentations are not just about following a formula for transferring facts in your head to the heads of those sitting before you by reciting a list of points on a slide. (If it were, why not send an email and cancel the presentation?) what people want is something fundamentally more human. They want to hear "the story" of your facts.

### Finding your voice

> When you are in a conversation with someone you are naturally more engaged because you have an obligation to participate. Formal speech and formal writing devoid of any emotion whatsoever is extremely difficult to stay with for more than a few minutes. Your conscious mind has to remind you to "stay awake, this is important!" But someone who speaks in a natural, human, conversational style is far easier to stay engaged with.

## The Process

1. Brainstorm. Get analog, do not edit ideas, let it flow.
2. Group and identify the core. Identify the key idea that is central and memorable from the point of view of the audience. Group similar ideas while looking for unifying theme. One core message + three supporting parts/“acts” is a good structure.
3. Storyboard using post-it notes or print out blank slides.
4. Storyboard in Slide Sorter/Light Table view. Duplicate section slides, which should be a different colour with enough contrast that they stand out when you see them in the slide sorter view. Have an introduction to introduce the issue or “the pain” and introduce the core message.

## Editing and Restraint

> Always keep the audience in mind by first keeping your talk as short as you can and still doing an effective job telling your story. After you have prepared your presentation, go back and edit like crazy, eliminating parts that are not absolutely crucial to your overall point or purpose of the talk. You must be ruthless. When in doubt, cut it out.



# Design

## Kanso, Shizen, Shibumi

* **Kanso (Simplicity).** Beauty and visual elegance are achieved by elimination and omission. “Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means.” 
* **Shizen (Naturalness).** Do not use elaborate designs, do not over-refine, do not overplay. Include only what’s necessary to communicate the particular message for the particular audience.
* **Shibumi (Elegance).** Elegant simplicity and articulate brevity, and understated elegance.

> Japanese conceptualisation relegates elaborate ornamentation and vivid colour usage to the bottom of the taste levels. Excess requires no real thought or creativity. The highest level of taste moves beyond the usage of brilliant colours and heavy ornamentation to a simple and subdued refinement that is the beauty of shibumi, which represents the ultimate in good taste through conscious reserve. This is the original ‘less is more’ concept. Less colour - subdued and elegant usage of colour, less clutter.

The Zen aesthetic values:

* Simplicity
* Subtlety
* Elegance
* Suggestive rather than the descriptive or obvious
* Naturalness (i.e., nothing artificial or forced)
* Empty space
* Stillness, tranquillity
* Eliminating the nonessential

##The “Fish Story”

> When Vijay opened his store, he put up a sign that said: “We Sell Fresh Fish Here.” His father stopped by and said that the word “We” suggests an emphasis on the seller rather than the customer, and is really not needed. So the sign was changed to “Fresh Fish Sold Here.”
> His brother came by and suggested that the word “here” could be done away with – it was superfluous. Vijay agreed and changed the sing to “Fresh Fish Sold.”
> Next, his sister came along and said the sign should just say “Fresh Fish.” Clearly, it is being sold; what else could you be doing?
> Later, his neighbour stopped by to congratulate him. Then he mentioned that all passers-by could easily tell that the fish was really fresh. Mentioning the word fresh actually made it sound defensive as though there was room for doubt about the freshness. Now the sign just read: “FISH.”
> As Vijay was walking back to his shop after a break he noticed that one could identify the fish from its smell from very far, at a distance from which one could barely read the sign. He knew there was no need for the word “FISH.”

## Amplification through simplification

Eliminate the detail.

### Simplicity is not easy 

The approach may take more time for you to prepare, but if you give a completely worthless one-hour death-by-PowerPoint presentation to an audience of 200, that equals 200 hours of wasted time. But if you instead put in the time, say, 25–30 hours or more of planning and designing the message, and the media, then you can give the world 200 hours of worthwhile, memorable experience.

It is possible to be “too simple”. Your job is to find the balance most appropriate to your situation.

## Design Principles

### Signal vs Noise Ratio

Communicate and design clearly with as little degradation to the message as possible. If the item can be removed without compromising the visual message, then strong consideration should be given to minimising the element or removing it altogether. E.g. lines in grids or tables can often be made quite thin, lightened, or even removed. And footers and logos, etc. can usually be removed with good results.

But some visuals could be included if they support the message at a more emotional level. As with all things, balance is important and the use of emotional elements depends on your particular circumstance, audience, and objectives.

2D charts and graphs are almost always a better solution as 3-D charts appear less accurate and can be difficult to comprehend.

### Logos

> If you are presenting for an organisation, try removing logos from all except the first and last slide. If you want people to learn something and remember you, then make a good, honest presentation. The logo won't help make a sell or make a point, but the clutter it brings does add unnecessary noise and makes the presentation visuals look like a commercial.

### How many bullet points for slide?

> Use bullet points only very rarely and only after you have considered other options for displaying the information in a way that best supports your point visually.

People will tire quickly if several slides of bulleted lists are shown one after another.

## Picture Superiority Effect

> Ask yourself this: What information are you representing with the written word on a slide that you could replace with a photograph (or other appropriate image or graphic)?

For inspiration: Jeff Brenman, the creator of Apollo Ideas, has a talent for combining images and text in a way that is fresh and effective for augmenting the presenter's messages.

### Quotes

> Quotes can add credibility to your story and a simple quote is a good springboard from which you can launch your next topic or weave into your narrative to support your point. Remember, quotes should be short, in most cases, since it can become quite tedious when a presenter reads a paragraph from a screen.

Considering placing the quote inside a larger photo rather than using a small photo or other element.

## Others

* Empty Space
* Contrast
* Repetition
* Alignment
* Proximity


# Delivery

> Beyond mastering technique, the secret to swordsmanship rests in obtaining a proper mental state of “no mind” where the mind is “abandoned and yet not abandoned.” 

* Practice and practice and practice. You will make it look easy and natural by preparing and practising like mad. The more you rehearse, the more confident you'll become, and the easier it will seem to the audience. 
* However, though you must plan well, being fully in the moment also means that you remain flexible, totally aware, and open to the possibilities as they arise. When you put in the hard work in the preparation phase and internalise the material, you can perform your art – the art of presentation – in a way that is more natural by obtaining the proper state of mind, that is, “no mind”.
* Mistakes may happen, but do not dwell on past mistakes or worry about future ones. Be only in this moment, sharing and conversing with the audience in front of you.

> In playing a musical instrument such as the piano, for example, sometimes you play at it and sometimes you play in it. The goal is not to repeat the notes on a page but to play beautiful music. To be *in* it, not separate from it. Great musicians play in it (even if they are not always technically perfect). The same thing holds for presentations. The aim should be to be in it completely at that moment in time.

## Presenting Under Fire

> In my experience, when I have received challenging questions from a skeptical or even hostile or aggressive person, a natural, nonaggressive response form myself always proves more effective than showing any irritation or defensiveness. Butting heads is very easy to do, but usually leads to a sure defeat for the presenter.

## Contribution & Being in the Moment

> This is the moment – this is the most important moment right now. Which is: We are about contribution. That's what our job is. It's not about impressing people. It's not about getting the next job. It's about contributing something... Did you do it better than the next violinist, or did he do better than a pianist? I don't care, because in contribution, there is no better!" – Benjamin Zander

Rather than asking questions such as "Will I be appreciated?" or "Will I win them over?", ask "How can I make a contribution?".

## Passion, Risk, and "Playing on One Buttock"

> Only through mistakes can you see where you're lacking, where you need to work. We hate mistakes, so we play it safe. Yet long term, nothing could be more dangerous if your goal is to be great at what you do... Instead of getting so dejected by mistakes, we should instead exclaim loudly, raising our arms (or to ourselves) "How fascinating!" every time we make a mistake. Think about that. Another mistake? How fascinating! Another opportunity to learn something just presented itself. Another unlucky break? No worries! Move forward. You cannot worry about mistakes and be fully present in the moment at the same time.
> You can hold back, aim not to make an error and play it perfectly or you can say "Screw it! – I'll take a risk" and dare to learn into the music with intensity, colour, humanity, and passion.

If your content is worth talking about, then bring energy and passion to your delivery. Every situation is different, but there is never an excuse for being dull.

## Don't take yourself so seriously!

> From birth we are concerned about measurement and worried about the perceived scarcity of love, attention, food, and so on that seems to be the way of the world. This is the "calculating self", and in this environment of scarcity, competition, and comparison "the self needs to be taken very seriously indeed." No matter how successful and confident you may become as an adult, your "calculating self" is weak and sees itself at risk of losing everything.
> The goal, then, is to move away from the calculating self, the self that lives in a world of scarcity, exaggerated threats, and deficiencies, and move toward a healthier attitude of sufficiency, wholeness, and possibilities. Getting over yourself – and humour is a great vehicle for this – allows you to see the "creative nature of the world and ourselves." When you understand what an infant can't – that is, you cannot control the world, you cannot impose your will on people's hearts – you begin to get over yourself. When you learn to lighten up, you see yourself as permeable, not vulnerable, and you stay open to the unknown and to new influences, new ideas. Rather than trying to resist and fight the river of life, you move through it with a harmonious fluidity and grace, learning to join rather than resist the flow. Humour is a wonderful way to remind everyone around us – no matter how hard the work gets – that our true and most "central" self is not obsessed with childish demands, entitlements, and calculations but is instead supportive, confident, helpful, and even inspiring. A presentation is as good a time as any to let people see that side of you.


# Connecting with the Audience

## One secret to a healthy life (and a great presentation): eat until 80% full

No matter how much time you are given, never ever go over time, and in fact finish a bit before your allotted time is up. Try to shoot for 90–95% of your allotted time. No one will complain. The problem with most presentations is that they are too long, not that they are too short.

Leave them just a little hungry (for more)

End on a high note, give them high quality – the highest you can – but do not give them so much quantity that you leave them with their heads spinning and guts aching.

## Remove barriers to communication

* Don't present from behind a lectern
* Keep the lights on; the audience must always be able to see you
* Use a small remote with basic features to advance slides
