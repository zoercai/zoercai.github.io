After seeing the brand new Acer S7 my friend got her mum to bring home from America, alongside the equally thin, beautiful, and powerful ultrabooks displayed alongside by others in our study/social group, I finally caved in. I needed a new laptop.

To be honest, this combination of peer pressure and competitive vanity was only a catalyst for my decision. I’ve just about wasted all of my free time between lectures in the past two years trying to find a spare computer in the crowded labs and libraries. And it got worse when my courses got more project-based, and my lecturers started giving out assignments and projects that specified Ubuntu as the required operating system to code in. Not many labs in the university had computers with both Ubuntu and the other required software installed.

For almost three years I’ve had a Toshiba Satellite C665D (specs) with a cracked case that kept dropping out little plastic bits every other time I opened up the screen or moved the laptop around, and for at least two years before that I’ve used an Acer Aspire 5310 with 1GB of RAM and Windows Vista custom installed on it - both were heavy and difficult to carry around while walking up and down the hills of Auckland, and I gave up after two tries and two sore shoulders, and went back to waiting around the computer labs around for someone to leave.

Now, two years of university behind me and still firm on my choice of software engineering as a degree and career path, I decided buying myself a new laptop is the way to go. And I deserve something good this time. Something light that doesn’t look like a dinosaur - both in size and age - next to my friends’ ultrabooks.

These are my requirements, from the most important to least:

* Processor: at least an Intel Core i5
* Weight: no more than 1.7kg, preferably below 1.5kg
* Battery life: at least up to 7 hours with Wifi on
* Price: below NZD $2000, preferably around/below $1500
* RAM: at least 6GB
* Storage: at least 500GB, preferably 1TB, but willing to compromise for SSD of at least 256GB
* Resolution: the higher the better, but really don’t care that much as long as it’s not below 1366x768

As these were quite specific requirements, it was easy to filter down the laptops that fit the description. I quickly learned that i7 started at around $2000, so that went out of the equation, and that my long-time concept of MacBooks being overpriced was, embarrassingly, a common misconception. 

These are the laptops I narrowed down:

A couple of HP models (HP EliteBook Folio 9470m D7Y59PA and HP ProBook 430 G1 F3K27PA) were ignored because no physical store had them in stock, and I don't like buying from online stores I've never heard of before.

The Acer Aspire V3 puzzled me, with slightly worse but still similar specs, it was almost half the price of the other models out there. I couldn’t figure out why, so I ended up asking someone on the PbTech online chat. The reply I got was: “Acer is a cheaper brand, you can get better parts for less.” I didn’t argue with the guy, but I still doubt his reply, seeing the Acer Aspire S7 listed just below the V3 selling for over $2000. As I couldn’t figure out what was actually wrong with the model, I decided to give it a try. But I soon realized the catch. PbTech had no stock, and JBHiFi, the only other store I knew that had it in stock, was selling it at $999. So I moved on and down my table.

The Dell Inspiron looked promising, until I came across a review that revealed it had an average battery life of 4 hours, and I figured if I had to carry a charger to uni, I might as well add the weight onto the laptop. Its price tag of $1249, about $300 below the Macbook Air and the Surface Pro 3, was simply not worth the lower battery life and heavier weight.

The Asus Zenbook seemed to be an all-rounder, but with it being priced only $89 below the Microsoft Surface Pro, I quickly looked on.

What followed was a lengthy debate between the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and the MacBook 13” air. While the Surface has an advantage in weight, RAM, stylus/touch capabilities, and operating system (I’ve used Windows all my life, and though I’m more than willing to try OS X out, I’d need spend time learning to use it, and most importantly, get a complete new suite of software), the Air has the larger screen size, the battery life, and, well, we're talking Apple.

There was something I didn’t realize, however. The Surface Pro 3 keyboard wasn't sold with the tablet, and had to be bought separately for an additional $200 - this, I could use to get more RAM for the Air. The debate continued for an entire day, consciously, and for another two days, subconsciously.

The final decision came after my dad said, “the Surface Pro 3 is a tablet with a potentially flimsy keyboard and a smaller screen which isn’t good for your eyes in the long term, and you need a laptop for work and serious typing. Also, pulling out a MacBook while sitting in a café shows you’re a professional with a good taste.” Well, he certainly knew how to convince me.

After I decided on the MacBook Air, I found Apple for Education, a discount scheme for students, teachers, and parents. For $1724, I could get a 13’’ MacBook Air with 1.4GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD.

I’m not buying the MacBook Air yet, of course, as [this site](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com alerted me that a new generation of Air is expected to be released early next year. And since uni’s not until March, I have plenty of time to wait.


What I learned:

* MacBooks are definitely not overpriced.
* The life expectancy of MacBooks, according to most people online, is around 5-8 years, whereas my expectation of PCs is around 3 years. A calculation of cost per year shows that MacBooks are worth the higher price.
* Apparently MacBooks lose their value much slower than PCs do.
* The 12 hour battery life and the 1.3kg weight of the MacBook Air is simply an irresistible combination for a  uni student like me.
* A 13” screen is just about the lowest one should go for a machine that’s going to be used daily.
* Pulling out a MacBook while sitting in a café shows you’re a professional with a good taste.
