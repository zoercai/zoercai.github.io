It's internship application season, and we're all scrambling to get our resume perfected and submitted. A good resume should achieve two goals. The first is obvious - to indicate you have the skills and experience needed for the job. The second, however, is less obvious to many people - to convince the guy who has go to through hundreds of resumes to notice yours, and actually read it.

Well-designed resumes are more likely to be read, and hence are more likely to lead to interviews. Usability research concludes that people are more forgiving of the faults of a system if the user interface is well-designed. Similarly, the HR department _might_ just forgive a typo if the rest of your resume looks beautiful (that's not to say you shouldn't spell-check for a tenth time before you submit your resume though).

Like user interface design, a good resume design doesn't simply mean pretty colours or cool graphics. A well-designed resume should attract and retain attention, be legible, and emphasize the parts of the resume that matter. 

Common sense says that bullet points should be used instead of paragraphs because they look shorter and are easier to read, that white space should be applied generously so there's breathing space, and that the fonts should be legible and complementary.

The less-common sense says that the content should be minimal. They say that "a good speech is like a miniskirt - long enough to cover all the vital parts, short enough to entice and captivate listeners". The same applies to resumes.

After you've pruned out the superfluous, sliced up your paragraphs, and ..., you'll want to focus on visual design. Specifically, the layout and the fonts.

The layout and the fonts are of the utmost importance when it comes to resume design because there are no images nor (in most cases) colours. So in the end, the layout and the font are the only two visual mediums that convey your personality and set the visual style of your resume.

But layouting a resume is difficult. Googling "resume design inspiration" will get you page after page of "designer resumes" that no one applying for a non-designer job should ever use. Unlike designers, what we're aiming for in a resume is simplicity, elegance, and subtle attention-seeking.

And that's where this post comes in (and where I finally get to the point). Below are some inspirational resume designs that I've found online that I think are appropriate for non-designers. I've given credit by linking the images to their sources where I could, but if you see your work here and would like it credited please contact me.
