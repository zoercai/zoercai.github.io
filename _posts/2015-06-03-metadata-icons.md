Updated the meta section for the posts today, as I wanted to use symbols in front of each meta text, I came across these two questions which I should have researched the answers to a long time ago.

# Vector Icons or Icon Fonts?

Vector Icons. Fpr a bunch of reasons, the most important probably being that vector icons are resizable without quality loss and appear extra sharp on retina displays.

[See detailed explanation by css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/).
By the way, [FlatIcon](http://www.flaticon.com) all the way.


# PNG or SVG?

SVG if you're hipster enough to not care about being compatible with the old browsers*, because [png isn't scalable without quality loss](http://www.compatt.com/lab/IandA/IandA_00-00-02.htm). Otherwise stick to png as it's a more accepted format.  

*Though apparently you can [enhance SVG accessibility using ARIA](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/12/using-aria-enhance-svg-accessibility/) (it's on my reading list).


# In other news...
I'm currently following David Kadavy's [Design for Hackers](http://designforhackers.com/) course, and the emphasis of the first two lessons so far has been simplifying and reducing choices when it comes to fonts. I've now just changed the post content font sizes according to his 3:4 typographic scale, definitely loving the simplification.
