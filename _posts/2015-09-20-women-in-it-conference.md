The theme of this year’s Women in IT conference was “Connect, Empower, Inspire”, and the speakers and workshops achieved the three objectives perfectly. 

The day started with Frances Valintine, the founder of The Mind Lab by Unitec, who inspired us when she spoke about her journey of founding The Mind Lab and her experience with educating a new generation of students with keyboard and screen instead of pen and paper, and the challenges faced getting young girls into technology.

The workshop which generated the most impact was Ruth Donde’s ‘A brain-based approach to connect, empower, inspire’. Ruth gave us five ways to alter a colleague’s perspective of management, facilitating them to learn, grow, change, and perform more efficiently. Ruth explained that we all have a primal fight or flight mechanism alert within us at all times, and it is easily triggered. Something as simple as saying “let me give you some feedback” can trigger fight-or-flight and induce a significant amount of stress within the listener. Now the listener, instead of listening to our feedback, spends all of their time preparing for their fight or flight.

The solution was all about removing fear and emphasising rewards, as well as focusing on solutions instead of problems. Here are the five ways to reduce stress and improve efficiency:

* **Connectedness**: having a “best friend” at work to talk to can make successes feel more rewarding and obstacles less challenging. Letting it out reduces stress. So encourage others to socialise and form relationships at work.
* **Choice**: create choice within constraints. This was the most helpful point. An example Ruth gave was arranging a meeting. If a meeting must be scheduled today, give the other person the choice of meeting time and location.
* **Certainty**: take the guesswork out of the equation to remove stress.
* **Continuous Progress**: give a sense of continuous small gains. It was found that verbal recognition is valued higher than financial, so small encouragements and celebrations matter a lot!
* **Contribution**: having meaning and purpose is important to most people when working on something. Let them know that they’re doing things that matter.

Another important fact Ruth spoke about was that when we think of an idea ourselves we spark an insight in our brain, which gives rise to ownership, making us want to do something with the idea. In the same way, giving others freedom to do things their own way to produce a predefined result can increase responsibility and ownership of work. 

Speaker highlight of the day was Julie Raue, who worked her way up from a contractor to the CIO of Air New Zealand, all without a tech-related degree!

The conference introduced new ideas in tech and enhanced my leadership skills – thanks WEN for sponsoring my ticket, it was a great day!
