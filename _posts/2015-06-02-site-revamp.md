I'm working on a new layout for the blog and project pages. The old layout presented the posts in a more article-like way, which made me less inclined to blog regularly due to that invisible threshold. I think I was subconsciously expecting myself to only publish posts that were informative and formal. I will aim for more of a stream-of-consciousness style in my (hopefully) frequent upcoming posts.
