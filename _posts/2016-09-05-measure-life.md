I took SOFTENG 701 — advanced software engineering development methods — last semester as one of my part IV software engineering electives, and the second half of the course was on good software design and included measurement theory. Learning and thinking about measuring software design at the same time as applying for my graduate job and making travel plans inspired me to look for ways of measuring my life. Perhaps if I could figure out a way to measure my life, then I’d be able to answer the age-old question: “what’s the meaning of life?” So I Googled and found this book. While I cannot say that I understand the meaning of life now that I’ve read this book, this book did give me new insight on life and its purpose, as well as my direction for the future.

Below is a summary of what I found the most valuable and inspiring, consisting mostly of quotes taken directly from the book. There are sections on raising children that I’ve not quoted, but I have read them and they were just as wise as the other chapters. There are a lot more stories in the book that illustrate the points below more fully, so I would definitely recommend reading the book, or at least the sections relevant to yourself.

# Finding Happiness in Your Career

## Priorities — what’s most important to you in your career?

“One the one hand, she was so engaged by the experiment she was doing that she wanted to stay at work; but on the other, she was so looking forward to spending time with her husband and children that she clearly wanted to be at home… I felt like I could see her go into her home at the end of that day with a replenished reservoir of esteem that profoundly affected her interaction with her husband and those two lovely children. And I knew how she’d feel going into work the next day — motivated and energised."

Motivation Theory distinguishes between 2 different types of factors: hygiene factors and motivation factors.

**Hygiene factors** are things like status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices. Bad hygiene causes dissatisfaction. Compensation is a hygiene factor, not a motivator. If you instantly improve the hygiene factors of your job, you’re not going to suddenly love it. At best, you just won’t hate it anymore.

**Motivation factors** include challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth. Feelings that you are making a meaningful contribution to work arise from intrinsic conditions of the work itself.

“Yet it was not lost on me that many of my classmates had initially come to school for very different reasons. They’d written their entrance essays on their hopes for using their education to tackle some of the world’s most vexing social problems or their dreams of becoming entrepreneurs and creating their own businesses.

Periodically, as we were all considering our post graduation plans, we’d try to keep ourselves honest, challenging each other: “what about doing something important, or something you really love? isn’t that why you came here?” “Don’t worry,” came back the answer. “This is just or a couple years. I’ll pay off my loans, get myself in a good financial position, then I’ll go chase my real dreams."

It was not an unreasonable argument. The pressures we all face — providing for our families, meeting our own expectations and those of our parents and friends, and or some of use, keeping up with our neighbours — are tough. n the case of my classmates (and many graduating classes since), this manifested itself in taking jobs as bankers, fund managers, consultants, and plenty of other well-regarded positions. For some people, it was a choice of passion — they genuinely loved what they did and those jobs worked out well for them .But for others, it was a choice based on getting a good financial return on their expensive degree.

By taking these jobs, they managed to pay back their student loans. Then they got their mortgages under control and their families in conformable financial positions. But somehow that early pledge to return to their real passion after a couple of years kept getting deferred. “Just one more year…” or “I’m not sure what else I would do now.” All the while, their incomes continued to swell.

It wasn’t too long, however, before some of them privately admitted that they had actually begun to resent the jobs they’d taken — for what they now realised were the wrong reasons. Worse still, they found themselves stuck. They’d managed to expand their lifestyle to fit the salaries they were bringing it, and it was really difficult to wind that back. They’d made choices early on because of the hygiene factors, not true motivators, and they couldn’t find their way out of that trap."

Ask:

- is this work meaningful to me?
- Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?
- Am I going to learn new things?
- Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
- Am I going to be given responsibility?

## Balancing plans with opportunities

When you put in place a plan focused on these anticipated opportunities, you are pursuing a **deliberate strategy**. The second source of options is unanticipated — usually a cocktail of problems and opportunities that emerges while you are trying to implement the deliberate plan or strategy that you have decided upon.” This could become the **emergent strategy**.
In our lives and in our careers, whether we are aware of it or not, we are constantly navigating a path by deciding between our deliberate straggles and the unanticipated alternatives that emerge. Each approach is vying for our minds and our hearts, making its best case to become our actual strategy. Neither is inherently better or worse; rather, which you should choose depends on where you are on the journey.

If you have found an outlet in your career that provides both the requisite hygiene factors and motivators, then a deliberate approach makes sense. Your aspirations should be clear, and you know from your present experience that they are worth striving for. Rather than worrying about adjusting to unexpected opportunities, your frame of mind should be focused on how best to achieve the goals you have deliberately set.

But if you haven’t reached the pint of finding a career that does this for you, then like a new company finding its way, you need to be emergent. This is another way of saying that if you are in these circumstances, experiment in life. As you learn from each experience, adjust. Then iterate quick. Keep going through this process until your strategy begins to click.

### How do you know if an emergent strategy is worth pursuing?

When a promising new idea emerges, financial projection should, of course, be made. But instead of pretending these are accurate, acknowledge that at this point, they are really rough.

Instead, ask the project teams to compile a list of all the assumptions that have been made in those initial projections. Then ask them: “Which of these assumptions need to prove true in order fro us to realistically expect that these numbers will materailze?”
Rank the assumptions from most important and least certain, to least important and most certain.

Similarly, before you take a job, carefully list what things others are going to need to do or to deliver in order for you to successfully achieve what you hope to do. Ask yourself, “what are the assumptions that have to prove true in order for me to be able to succeed in this assignment?” List them. Are they within your control?

Equally important, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy in the choice you are contemplating. Are you basing your position on extrinsic or intrinsic motivators? Why do you think this is going to be something you enjoy doing? Why evidence do you have? Every time you consider a career move, keep thinking about the most important assumptions that have to prove true, and how you can swiftly and inexpensively test if they are valid. Make sure you are being realistic about the path ahead of you.

## Your strategy is not what you say it is

We have resources — which include personal time, energy, talent, and wealth — and we are using them to try to grow several “businesses” in our personal lives. These include having a rewarding relationship with our spouse or significant other; raising great children; succeeding in our careers; contributing to our church or community; and so on. Unfortunately, however, our resources are limited and these businesses are competing for them. It’s exactly the same problem that a corporation has. How should we devote our resources to each of the pursuits?

Unless you manage it mindfully, your personal resource allocation process will decide investments for you according to the “default” criteria that essentially are wired into your brain and you heart.

But it’s a messy process. People ask of your time and your energy every day, and even if you are focused on what’s important to you, it’s still difficult to know which are the right choices. If you have an extra ounce of energy or a spare thirty minutes, thereat e a lot of people pushing you to spend them here rather than there.

Be careful not to prioritise things that give immediate returns all the time — such as a promotion, a raise, or a bonus — rather than the things that require long-term for, the things that you won’t see a return on for decades.

A strategy — whether in companies or in life — is created through hundreds of everyday decisions about how you spend your time, energy, and money. With every moment of your time, every decision about how you spend your energy and your money, you are making a statement about what really matters to you. You can talk all you want about having a clear purpose and strategy for your life, but ultimately this means nothing if you are not investing the resources you have in a way that is consistent with your strategy. In the end, a strategy is nothing but good intentions unless it’s effectively implemented.

How do you make sure that you’re impelemting the strategy you truly want to implement? Watch where your resources flow.

# Finding Happiness in Your Relationships

The relationships you have with family and close friends are going to be the most important sources of happiness in your life. But you have to be careful. When it seems like everything at home is going well, you will be lulled into believing that you can put your investments in these relationships onto the back burner. That would be an enormous mistake. By the time serious problems arise in those relationships, it often is too late to repair them. This means, almost paradoxically, that the time when it is most important to invest in building strong families and close friendships is when it appears, at the surface, as if it’s not necessary.

## What job did you hire that milkshake for?

Many products fail because companies develop them from the wrong perspective. Companies focus too much on what they want to sell their customers, rather than what those customers really need. What’s missing is empathy: a deep understanding of what problems customers are trying to solve. The same is true in our relationships: we go into them thinking about we we want rather than what is important to the other person. Changing your perspective is a powerful way to deepen your relationships.

Let me share an example from Scott, a friend of mine with three children under the age of five. One day recently, Scott came home from work to find a highly unusual scene — the breakfast dishes still on the table and dinner not started. His instant reaction was that his wife, Barbara, had had a tough day and needed a hand. Without a word, he rolled up his sleeves, cleaned up the breakfast dishes, and started dinner. Partway through, Barbara disappeared. But Scott kept on, making dinner for the kids. He had just started feeding them when he suddenly wondered, where’s Barbara? Tired, but feeling pretty good about himself, he went upstairs to try to figure out where she was. He found her alone in their bedroom. He expected to be thanked for doing all that at the end of an exhausting day at work. But instead Barbara was very upset — at him.
He was shocked. He had just done all this for her. What had he done wrong?
“How could you ignore me after I’ve had such a difficult day?” Barbara asked.
“You think that I’ve ignored you?” Scott responded. “I finished the breakfast dishes, cleaned up the kitchen, fixed dinner, and am partway through feeding our children. How in the world can you think I’ve ignored you?”
Just then, it became clear to Scott what had happened. Indeed, what he did was important to get done, and he was trying to be selfless in giving Barbara exactly what he thought she needed. Barbara explained, however, that the day hadn’t been difficult because of the chores. It was difficult because she had spent hours and hours with small, demanding children, and she hadn’t spoken to another adult all day. What she needed most at that time was a real conversation with an adult who cared about her. But doing what he did, he only made Barbara feel guilty and angry about her frustration.

It’s so easy to mean well but get it wrong.

Asking yourself “what job does my spouse most need me to do?” gives you the ability to think about it in the right unit of analysis. When you approach your relationships from this perspective, the answers will become much more clear than they would by simply speculating about what might be the right thing to do.

But you have to go beyond understanding what job your spouse needs you to do. You have to do that job. You’ll have to devote your time and energy to the effort, be wiling to suppress your own priorities and desires, and focus on doing what is required to make the other person happy. Nor should we be timid in giving our children and our spouses the same opportunities to give themselves to others. You might think this approach would actually cause resentment in relationships because one person is so clearly giving up something for the other. But I have found that it has the opposite effect. In sacrificing for something worthwhile, you deeply strengthen your commitment to it.

# Staying out of Jail

Most of us think that the important ethical decisions in our lives will be delivered with a blinking red neon sign : CAUTION: IMPORTANT DECISION AHEAD. Never mind how busy we are or what the consequences might be. Almost everyone is confident that in those moments of truth, he or she will do the right thing. After all, how many people do you know who believe they do not have integrity?

The problem is, life seldom works that way. It comes with no warning signs. Instead, dos of us will face a series of small, everyday decisions that rarely seem like they have high stakes attached. But over time, they can play out far more dramatically.

## Marginal thinking — "Just this once…"

When a company is faced with making an investment in future innovation, it usually crunches the numbers to decide what to do from the perspective of its existing operations. Based on how those numbers play out, it may decide to forego the investment if they marginal upside is not worth the marginal cost of undertaking the investment. But there’s a big mistake buried in that thinking.

And that’s the trap of marginal thinking. You can see the immediate costs of investing, but its’ really hard to accurately see the costs of not investing. When you decide that the upside of investing in the new product isn’t substantial enough while you still have a perfectly acceptable existing product, you aren’t taking into account a future in which somebody else brings the new product to market. You’re assuming everything else — specifically, the money you make on the old product — will continue forever exactly as it has up until now. A company may not see any consequences of that decision for some time. It might not get “caught’ in the short term if a competitor doesn’t get ahead. But the company that makes all its decision through this marginal cost lens will, eventually, pay the price. So often this is what causes successful companies to keep from investing in their future, and, ultimately, to fail.
The same is true of people, too.

The only way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions in your life is to never start making them in the first place. When the first step down that path presents itself, turn around and walk the other way.
